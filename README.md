# COVID-19 Healthcare Virtual Agent using Google Dialogflow CX platform
A conversational chatbot to help companies to support their employees in:

1. Issuing a Clearance pass that is required for entering the office building. Employees will complete a health screening and get the clearance pass for reporting to work in person.

1. Providing guidance to employees on how to isolate or quarantine and for how long - It will ask a series of questions to provide the correct guidance for the individualâ€™s situation.

1. Helping them find nearby COVID-19 vaccine centers based on various attributes; for example, if drop-ins are allowed, wheelchair accessibility, nearest centers from the individualâ€™s address, etc. It will gather information from the customer and provide them vaccine center details include links to make an online appointment using the rich cards. It will use a webhook to fetch real-time data maintained by the SF Public Health Department.

1. Locating nearby Cornavirus Testing centers within 20 miles of the location provide by the visitor, etc. It will gather information from the customer and provide them testing location details include eligibility information for accessing testing at this location. The DialogFlow will use a webhook to fetch real-time data maintained by the SF Public Health department of testing locations.

## Approach
Dialogflow Fulfillment mechanism is using multiple webhooks built using node.js (deployed as GAE apps).
This module is a webhook example for Dialogflow. The webhook connects to a Cloud Firestore to validate the visitor by email (or employee id) and storing clearance passes.

## Technical Stack
* Cloud Firestore
* GAE apps
* Dialogflow CX

## Setup Instructions
### Project Setup
How to setup your project for this example can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/quick/setup).

### Dialogflow Agent Setup

1. Build an agent by following the instructions [here](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/quick/build-agent).
1. Import (restore) the agent using the following instructions [here](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/agent#export).
1. Follow the instructions to restore the agent from "exported_agent_COVID-19 Healthcare Virtual Agent.blob".


### Google App Engine Setup
This implementation is deployed on GCP using App Engine.
More info [here](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/nodejs/quickstart).

To run the node.js scripts on GCP, the `gcloud` command-line tool from the Google Cloud SDK is needed.
Refer to the [installation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install) page for the appropriate
instructions depending on your platform.

Note that this project has been tested on a Unix-based environment.

After installing, make sure to initialize your Cloud project:

`$ gcloud init`

### Cloud Firestore Setup (Use Native mode database)
Quick start for Cloud Firestore can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/quickstart-servers#create_a_in_native_mode_database).

Make sure to setup rules for allowing writes on the new database

    rules_version = '2';
    service cloud.firestore {
        match /databases/{database}/documents {
            match /{document=**} {
                allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
            }
        }
    }

#### How to add data
This example connects to a Cloud Firestore with a collection with the following specification:

    Root collection
     user-data =>
         document_id
             uCQVcprA2PWMPOD4XJTi => {
                 'email': 'alok.gupta@pridequest.com',
                 'empId': 12345
             }

Examples how to add data to a collection can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/quickstart-servers#add_data).

    const Firestore = require('@google-cloud/firestore');
    const db = new Firestore({
        projectId: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID',
        keyFilename: '/path/to/keyfile.json',
    });

    const docRef = db.collection('user-data').doc('12345');

    await docRef.set({
        empId: 12345,
        email: 'alok.gupta@pridequest.com'
    });
